# USART_1
This program is developed to give a basic example about USART serial communication. 
The first board (the master, NUCLEO-L496ZG board) transmits datas which are received by the second one (the slave, NUCLEO-U575ZI board). 
To permit the observer to understand if everything is right during the communication, we use built-in leds of the 2 boards.
